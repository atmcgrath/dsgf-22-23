    Current challenges:

    - Maya interface in the version I'm using is different from the tutorial--makes it hard to find things and navigate
    - There seem to be more limited options on my version--this may because it's a student version?
    - Basic set up issues: couldn't use the color picker initially because of security settings on my computer

    Still to do:

    - Add chrome texture to objects (by 2/4/22)
    - Animate figures (by 2/4/22?)
    - Export animation to a shareable version (deadline mid-February)




### 2021.12.15

- Completed personal website here: https://bit.ly/meghankel
  - passed the accessibility test using Wave tool
  - Still need to:
    - make adaptable layout for mobile devices
    - create an exhibitions link after spring exhibitions
    - possibly add a link to the 3-D Maya project I complete in the future
- Workshop ideas:
  - These could be done individually or as a series:
    - Stereograph coloring station: Stereographs are printed and sized ahead of time. Students color in sepia prints with colored pencils and view with stereoscopes. The coloring will help illustrate how the stereoscope works. Students could learn about digital stereograph collections here: https://stereo.nypl.org 
    - Make your own anaglyphs. Students either bring in pictures or make their own digital art, convert to anaglyph form (several free image converters online), and then view with anaglyph glasses (red and cyan glasses) we provide. Or we could make the glasses ourselves.
    - Make your own Magic Eye image: https://www.easystereogrambuilder.com
    - Maya workshop recreating my the project I complete in the future. (Workshop may require several sessions, depending on how complex the workshop is)
