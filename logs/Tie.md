### SMART GOALs for Fall: 
1. Develop a high-quality website and code it myself and further customize to meet project needs and display project developments 
2. Research and evidence knowledge of specific digital competencies related to my own Social Work interests 
   - SPECIFIC -> Create a timeline and goal sheet across the semester (integrated below).
   MEASURABLE -> Create deadlines to correspond with the timeline (below)
   ACTIONABLE -> 1. Use xcode, Visual Studio Code, HTML on ongoing simple website that will eventually host and exhibit the following: project work; descriptions and breakdowns of selected digital competencies; prospective poll(s) of Social Work students' desired competencies; poll results into data sets; educational video content; sample syllabus; mini-lesson plans.- 11/2021 through 12/12/21
For the Fall Semester of this fellowship, the primary goal is only for the site to be coded/developed in correspondence with display of my selected area of interest in digital competency. In short, this site will "show what I know." Its development will be shaped by what I am learning in fellowship, and on my own. Tangible evidence will be in written form. 
3. Research digital competencies most relevant to my interests in Social Work intervention, theory, practice, or research AND make a list of interest areas - by 11/19/2021
4. Narrow interest areas down to the most relevant area that I will commit to building mastery in by 11/19/2021
5. Work on building mastery in 6 separate concentrated learning sessions called "mastery sessions." These sessions will occur twice a week, specifically for 3 hours on the following dates: 11/22, 11/24,11/29, 12/1, 12/6, and 12/8. In these sessions I will be utilizing vetted digital competency related tutorials and other learning materials. Each "mastery session" will have a separate labeled page on my website with images and/or video of my own work, and an accompanying detailed summary of my expanding understanding of my chosen digital competency.5.Publish my "completed" website (in quotes as the website will continue to grow over the Spring term and hopefully after) by 10 pm on 12/12






**Future Action Work for the Spring:
1.Create poll(s) for Social Work students to see which competencies are most relevant to their work
2.Distrubte poll(s) to cohorts 
1. Transfer polls into a data set and official rank on website
2. Work towards mastery of top 3 ranked skills - Divide work towards mastery into personal "mastery sessions" that will take place in the first half of the Spring semester.
5.Create content on personal website based on these sessions.
6.After focusing on mastery, move toward pedagogy - Design a workshop series of curated mini lessons on the top 3 ranked digital competences & complete necessary lesson plans
5.With the remainder of the Spring Semester, teach as many workshops as possible.**


RELEVANT -> Project is directly informed by my academic areas of interest.
TIME-BASED: The above deadlines are set to pace project goals, if further flexibility is needed, a meeting will be called with Alice to discuss pacing adjustment
