-need to create a clearer map/plan of my site with significant hydrological features

**11/30**
-Began filling out my excel sheets with data, have started to arrange fields. Working on the site of Gadara first.

-Almost done with my personal website design. Will finish it this week.
-My excel sheet is coming together, much slower than I anticipated.
-I've been experimenting with FreeCAD for a workshop, and I think its workable for an open source program. AutoCAD is still much better.
-Goals for winter break: finish updating excel sheet!


**01/19/22**
-Working on the final details for my website design. Having a few issues with formatting css, but should be resolved by next week. I plan to publish the site before the next meeting.
-My learning plan has been updated
-Workshop planning:Introduction to 2D CAD, 2-3 sessions max: Febuary 18, 25, and March 4, Using FreeCAD software. 10AM-12PM on campus in the media lab and virtual for those who can't come to campus. 
-I need to learn how to scale the image in this software, it is different than autocad's program. 
-Description: This workshop is a series of two (or three) sessions designed to teach basic 2D CAD (computer-aided design) skills in the Arts and Sciences. We will be using a free CAD software called FreeCAD, which works both on Windows and Mac computers. The skills learned from this CAD software are applicable for other CAD programs, such as AutoCAD. All sessions will be hybrid and take place in person in the Carpenter Library media lab and virtually through Zoom. In the first session, you will acquire the basics of how to digitize a raster drawing. You will learn how to scale your drawing, create layers, and use different line types. In the second session, we will discuss how to color coordinate layers, hatch certain features, and export your drawing as a PDF for publications. A third extra session, will be for those who wish to learn how to use CAD drawings with GIS programs. 


## SMART Goal(s)

Action plan: begin figuring out which software I want to use, so far using Excel seems like the best option, because I can export the data from it
start adding data 

## Week of 11/14:
- Set up excel sheet and designate fields for data input
